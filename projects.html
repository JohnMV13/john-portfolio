            This project is a fun little word game that my group did for our final 201 project in Delta V. The rules of this game are that you have to spell a word given the last letter of your opponent's word within the time limit provided. The longer the word and the more time that is left when you submit your word earns you points. This project was made by using JavaScript, HTMl and CSS.

        <p class='paranormal'>
          Paranormal Maptivity is a project where you can look at reports or incidents of different paranormal/extraterrestrial happenings. This project was created as our final 301 project for Delta V. This project used several different tools, including JQuery, JSON, some HTML, Handlebars, the implementation of four different external APIs and CSS.

        <p class='battleship'>
          This project was the final project for my 401 class in Delta V. With this project, we made our own API using NodeJs to run the back end of our server and our front end website is using React. BattleShip Delta I an online version of your everyday battleship boardgame. You sign in to the website, create a game, send an invite to your opponent (you must know the name of that person) and are given three ships, a two long, a three long and a four long. You place them by putting in the coordinates that you would like to use and wait for your opponent to place their ships. After that, the game begins by typing in a coordinate and hoping that you hit a ship.
