      <p class='about'>
        My name is John Miester. I am a web developer with experience in front end and back end development and a preference in front end development. I graduated from West Delaware High School in Manchester, Iowa. After graduating from high school, I went into the work force where I worked at a couple jobs at once. I started my career as a part time worker in the meat department of my local Fareway. After working there for a couple months, and realizing I would not have the chance to work full time there, I decided that I should get a full time job as well as work part time. My search for a full time job led me to a factory called Farmtek, where I worked full time on the night shift there. After working at Farmtek for a little over a year, I realized that I didn't want to work in a factory for the rest of my life, so I started looking for new job opportunities around the area as well as possible courses that I enjoyed doing during high school. That's when I found out about the Delta V program and let me tell you if anyone had told me at the beginning of 2018 that I would be taking a course in coding and web design, I honestly wouldn't have believed them.

      <h3>My time with Delta V</h3>
      <p class='delta'>
        Through Delta V, I have learned how to create and work with websites. Delta V has taught me how to use HTML, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery, JSON, NodeJS, React, GitHub, Heroku as well as working in a fast pace, high intensity workplace where projects needed to be completed within a week of starting them. Another thing that I've learned through Delta V is working in an Agile work place.
