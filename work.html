        I have been working part time at my local Fareway's meat department since May of 2016. My job there is to provide customers with a wonderful experience by talking with them, packaging their requested items and getting them their items in a timely manner. Thanks to Fareway, I've been able to work on my communication skills with customers as well as work in an environment where there is a lot of customer interations.

        I started working night shift at Farmtek in September of 2016 and stopped working there in May of 2018. While working at Farmtek, I learn how to work well with my coworkers due to the nature of the jobs we did. Farmtek heavily relies on teamwork to get our projects completed and shipped out to our customers. Thanks to our teamwork at farmtek, we were able to average about 15-20 orders a night with the sizes of the orders ranging from 20 feet by 20 feet to orders as big as 300 feet long by 70 feet wide.
